	<h3>The goal of this webpage is to showcase research data from my final project for GEOG-484L: Applications of Remote Sensing. Post-classification change-detection was applied to two Landsat 5 TM images to determine the vegetation change following the Murphy Complex Fire (2007). The top map shows the overall vegetation change withing the perimeter of the Murphy Complex Fire that occured on the Twin Falls District BLM. The bottom map show the classified vegetation from 2006, (before the Murphy Complex Fire), and the classified vegetation from after, (2008). The use of OpenLayers built-in "swipe" function was intended to allow users to visualize the change in vegetation over the landscape and easily compare the two time periods.</h3>
